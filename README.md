# WeatheringTheSandstorm
A little terminal game I made tonight in Node.js -- only tested on MacOS

WeatheringTheSandstorm
========

This is my first attempt at building a game in the context of the command line.
So far, I think it's turned out well for a tiny hack.

You play it by using the arrow keys (left and right) to move to the left or right. You must avoid
the big block bouncing around like a screensaver. The goal is to last as long as you can without
colliding with the large block.

The music playing is a chiptune version of Darude's Sandstorm.

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install

```

Run with `npm`, too:
``` bash
$ npm start

```
